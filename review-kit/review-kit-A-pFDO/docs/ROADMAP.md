# A-FDO Strategic Roadmap: From Research to Sovereignty

## Phase 1: Academic Validation (Q1 2026 - Q2 2026)
- [x] **v1.3.0-Industrial Specification** (GitHub Deployed): Full architectural definition with O(1) arbitration.
- [x] **Peer Review Submission**: IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management.
- [ ] **Peter Wittenburg Endorsement**: Direct outreach with "review-kit-A-pFDO" as physical proof of FAIR DO implementation.

## Phase 2: National Strategic Alignment (Q3 2026 - Q4 2026)
### 2.1 Xiong'an 1.6T Experimental Zone
- **Deployment Node**: Xiong'an New Area Digital Economy Cluster.
- **Objective**: Verify A-FDO over 1.6T optical links for low-latency governance.
- **Support**: Aligned with "Xiong'an Talent Cup" (雄才杯) innovation directives.

### 2.2 Medical Data Sovereignty Pilot (OMAP)
- **Partner**: Top-tier Class 3A Hospital (Hebei/Beijing).
- **Use Case**: Cross-institutional sharing of protected genomic data with pFDO-Inside governance.

## Phase 3: Global Standardization (2027+)
- **Standard Body**: IETF / IEEE 802.3dj Task Force.
- **Goal**: Establish pFDO as the de-facto standard for "Governance-Aware Networking" (GAN).
