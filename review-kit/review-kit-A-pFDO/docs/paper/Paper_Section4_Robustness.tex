\section{Adversarial Robustness: Defeating ``Semantic Vacuum''}
To address the concern regarding potential semantic degradation following the unlearning process, we conducted a \textbf{Logic Integrity Stress Test} on the RLCP protocol.

\subsection{Axiomatic Core vs. Volatile Facts}
We partitioned the A-FDO memory space into a protected \textbf{Axiomatic Core} (storing policy enforcement logic) and a \textbf{Volatile Fact} pool (initially 1,000,000 entries). A \textbf{99\% metabolic purge} was executed to simulate extreme unlearning.

\subsection{Experimental Results and Consistency}
The empirical data (see Table \ref{tab:robustness}) demonstrates that the logical accuracy remains at an absolute \textbf{100.0\%} despite the near-total loss of factual context. The execution latency exhibited a negligible deviation of only \textbf{0.02 $\mu$s}, decreasing from 2.0339 $\mu$s to 2.0127 $\mu$s. The Progressive Convergence of latency variance is attributed to the \textbf{Topology-Preserving Logic Metabolism}, which stabilizes the decision boundary. This confirms that the A-FDO logic core is physically and logically decoupled from factual redundancy, effectively negating the ``Semantic Vacuum'' hypothesis.

\subsection{Distributed Atomicity: Global Epoch Versioning}
To guarantee consistency across distributed enforcement nodes, we implement a \textbf{Global Epoch Versioning \& Two-Phase Atomic Switch} protocol.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 (Preparation)}: Nodes download the new policy $\pi_{t+1}$ into a shadow buffer. The policy is validated against the Axiomatic Core to ensure it resides within the safe manifold.
    \item \textbf{Phase 2 (Switch)}: Upon receiving the global switch signal $S_{switch}(Epoch_{t+1})$, all nodes atomically flip the active pointer.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Proof of Read-Write Separation:}
Let $R(t)$ be the set of active read operations (packet enforcement) at time $t$, and $W(t)$ be the write (policy update) operations. Since $W(t)$ occurs exclusively on the inactive shadow buffer and the switch is an atomic pointer swap operation $\text{swap}(\pi_{active}, \pi_{shadow})$, we have:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) \cap W(t) = \emptyset, \quad \forall t
\end{equation}
This property eliminates race conditions and ensures zero downtime during policy rollouts. Furthermore, the variance in update latency $\sigma^2_{\Delta t}$ demonstrates \textbf{Progressive Convergence} as the network scales, a direct result of the \textbf{Topology-Preserving Logic Metabolism} minimizing state disruption.
