## 1. The Critical Bottleneck
As the EU Digital Product Passport (DPP) mandates become pervasive, global supply chains face two irreconcilable challenges:
- **The Energy Paradox**: Maintaining active electronic tags for billions of assets is ecologically unsustainable.
- **The Privacy Paradox**: Centralized cloud tracking compromises the physical sovereignty of individual assets.

## 2. The pFDO Architecture Solution
We propose **Physical FAIR Digital Objects (pFDO)**—a decentralized framework rooted in three fundamental principles to bridge the gap between atoms and bits:

### I. Evolutionary Reference (Addressing Energy)
By adopting **Ambient Backscatter (AmBC)**, pFDOs leverage existing RF energy (Wi-Fi/5G) to achieve $\mu W$-level perception. This mimics biological sensory systems, allowing assets to exist in a "low-entropy" digital state without the need for active batteries.

### II. Controlled Co-prosperity (Addressing Sovereignty)
We introduce the **Matter-Immune Protocol (MIP)**. By utilizing physical-layer fingerprinting (e.g., multipath decay signatures), we ensure that security is derived from physical laws rather than pure computational power. In this framework, **Physical Proximity equals Security**, preventing remote data hijacking.

### III. Unknown Exploration (Addressing Interoperability)
The pFDO kernel utilizes decoupled metadata schemas, allowing assets to engage in emergent, self-organizing collaborations within complex logistics ecosystems without pre-defined central logic.

## 3. Conclusion and Call to Action
The pFDO framework is not merely a tracking technology but a "Digital Proprioception" for the physical world. We invite the International FDO Forum to adopt **Carbon-Silicon Synergy** as the foundational logic for the next generation of global asset indexing standards.
