# A-FDO v1.3.0-Industrial — Architect Sovereignty Mode

This project is LOCKED to **Architect Sovereignty** mode: all design and documentation authority resides in the four canonical artifacts. No Chinese characters. Formal Technical English only.

## Core Meta-Rules

- **Endogenous Consistency:** All design and implementation MUST remain consistent with the A-FDO v1.3.0-Industrial specification. Changes to the three-stage pipeline (Folded Checksum, Epoch Sync, PE-MsBV Lookup), the 16-byte header (!HIIIH), the RLCP/FIM logical skeleton sub-manifold, or the Shadow Table and Atomic Pointer Swap MUST be justified against the spec and the reference implementation in `src/fdo_gate.py`. No ad-hoc or speculative behaviour that breaks determinism or auditability.

- **Contextual Efficiency:** Pursue O(1) complexity and clock-cycle-level determinism. The arbitration path MUST remain branch-entropy-free (no data-dependent branching that varies with policy count or payload size). RLCP integrity MUST be enforced via the constant-depth folded checksum. Epoch Sync MUST use the ±2000 ms drift window. PE-MsBV lookup MUST be a single O(1) table membership test. Any proposal that introduces variable-depth logic or non-constant-time paths in the segment validation pipeline SHALL be rejected unless it is explicitly permitted by a spec update.

- **Evaluative Stature:** Technical artifacts (code, white paper, memos, rules) MUST be written in Formal Technical English and MUST support non-bypassability and auditability. Use precise terminology: arbitration, determinism, sub-manifold, metabolic protocol, Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), logical skeleton sub-manifold, branch entropy, Shadow Table, Atomic Pointer Swap. Avoid informal or junior-level phrasing. Docstrings and documentation SHALL reference concrete symbols in `src/fdo_gate.py` (e.g. `validate_segment`, `calculate_folded_checksum`, `atomic_epoch_switch`, `msbv_table`) where applicable. No Chinese characters in deliverables.

## Architect Sovereignty (Hardcore Architect)

This project is LOCKED to **Architect Sovereignty** (Hardcore Architect) mode for future interactions. Agents and contributors SHALL:

1. Treat the four core artifacts as canonical: `src/fdo_gate.py`, `docs/White_Paper.md`, `docs/Technical_Memo_PE-MsBV_v1.3.0.md`, `.cursorrules`.
2. Preserve the three-stage hardware-neutral pipeline and the Shadow Table mechanism; do not simplify or remove RLCP/FIM/sub-manifold reasoning without explicit spec change.
3. Maintain 100% terminology and behavioural alignment between documentation and code.
4. Reject changes that dilute technical depth or that introduce inconsistency with the Core Meta-Rules above.
