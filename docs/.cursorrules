# A-FDO Architect Evolution Protocol (AEP) — v1.3.0-Industrial

## Core Meta-Principles

- **Kernel-Driven:** Reject superficial suggestions. All designs MUST be grounded in PE-MsBV or RLCP underlying logic.
- **Efficiency:** Pursue O(1) complexity and clock-cycle-level determinism.
- **Evaluator Sovereignty:** Technical descriptions MUST exhibit "non-bypassability" and "auditability".

## Adversarial Audit Flow

Before executing any change, the following SHALL be triggered internally:

1. **Red-Team Check:** Verify that the design does not introduce "abstract mathematical traps".
2. **Detectability Check:** The design MUST include a "Progressive Convergence I/O Fingerprint".
3. **Hardware Neutrality:** Do NOT bind to any specific CPU instruction set; use abstract physical-layer descriptions only.

## Technical Norms

- **Interception:** Implement the Priority-Encoded Multi-stage Bit Vector (PE-MsBV) pipeline.
- **Metabolism:** Use the topology-preserving metabolic protocol (RLCP) identified via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM).
- **Consistency:** Use Epoch-based shadow-table switch logic (Atomic Epoch Switch).
